Installation
===============

github and pip install
------------

To install ``clustertools``, simply clone the GitHub repository and install via setup tools:

>>> git clone https://github.com/webbjj/clustertools.git
>>> cd clustertools
>>> python setup.py install

Please note that if you don't have permission to write files to the default install location (often /usr/local/lib), you will either need to run

>>> sudo python setup.py install

or

>>> python setup.py install --prefix='PATH'

where 'PATH' is a directory that you do have permission to write in and is in your PYTHONPATH.

It has recently become possible to install ``clustertools`` using pip:

>>> pip install clustertools

however please note this version is not updated as frequently as the GitHub repository. Similarly, if permissions are an issue, you can use:

>>> pip install --user clustertools

or

>>> pip install clustertools --install-option="--prefix=PATH"
